#### The games are:<br>

* Calculator: Arithmetic expressions that need to be computed.<br>
* Progression: Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.<br>
* Even Numbers: Determining even numbers.<br>
* Greatest Common Divisor: Finding the greatest common divisor (GCD).<br>
* Prime Numbers: Determining prime numbers.<br>

#### Install game:<br>
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GitUserMaxim/php-project-45gi

$ make install
```
